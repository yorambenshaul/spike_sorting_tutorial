# spike_sorting_tutorial
simple spike sorting tutorial 


This is a simple code (written originally for a course on MATLAB) to demonstrate the basic stages of spike sorting.The script should be mostly self-explanatory.
The idea is to generate a set of spike waveforms and then assign them with specific response proprties. 
Then, the code generates fake data with these spikes corresponding to the firing rates specified in the script.
Then, the spike times are extracted, sorted (using simple K means clustering) and the PSTHs are calculated.
